A deeply moralistic tale which hammers in the point, there's a consequence for every action. Two characters in the film verbalize this: one hitman who planned the hit on the cops, and the mom at the end. It's clear even from the name of the movie.

Is the cop God? Well he doesn't forgive, and he has a very clear sense of morality. "Do you know who he is?" Julian nods. As if he knows what's coming for him. Judgement.

Julian on the other hand, is a mortal man who's confused as to what he should become. He looks at his hands, washes them and sees blood, and he dreams of the cop coming one day and chopping his hands off. We later learn that he's a drug dealer.

He's broken sexually, probably by his incestuous family. When his mother dies, he inserts his hand in a cut, which is almost sexual.

About the cyclical nature of violence.
